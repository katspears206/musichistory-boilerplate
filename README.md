This is a project that was assigned as a part of a class and has been continually changed as we learned new skills at NSS. It started as a strictly HTML/CSS copy of a moqup and has  been developed into a functioning app using first Vanilla JavaScript, then jQuery, then finally Angular. 



Installation

bower install
npm install
  These two should install everything you need for the project to run properly
